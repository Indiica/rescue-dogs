# Rescue Dogs
Rescue Dogs is a site for Organisation "Rescue Dogs". This platform serves as a bridge between rescue dogs and their forever families. We focus on:

+ Dog Adoption: Connecting adoptive families with rescue dogs in need of a home.
+ Donations: Encouraging individuals to contribute to the care, medical treatment, and feeding of rescue dogs.
By adopting, donating, or even sharing our cause, you are helping to provide better futures for dogs and families alike.
