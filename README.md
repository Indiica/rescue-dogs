# Rescue Dogs
Rescue Dogs is a site for Organisation "Rescue Dogs". This platform serves as a bridge between rescue dogs and their forever families. We focus on:

+ Dog Adoption: Connecting adoptive families with rescue dogs in need of a home.

+ Donations: Encouraging individuals to contribute to the care, medical treatment, and feeding of rescue dogs.
By adopting, donating, or even sharing our cause, you are helping to provide better futures for dogs and families alike.

### **User story**
**Overview**

As a potential dog adopter or donor, I want to be able to:
1. Easily view profiles of dogs available for adoption
2. Donate to the rescue organization in a simple and secure way, knowing that my contributions will go toward the care, medical treatment, and shelter of the dogs in need.
3.  Access information about the organization's goals and impact, so I can feel confident in my support for their work.
